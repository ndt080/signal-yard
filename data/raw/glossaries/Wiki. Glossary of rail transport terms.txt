Air brake — Also Railway air brake. Any brake operated by air pressure, but usually restricted to systems of continuous brakes operated by compressed air, in distinction from Vacuum Brakes, which are operated by creating a vacuum. The air is compressed by some form of steam pump on the locomotive, or a motor-compressor on electric locomotives, and is conveyed by pipes and flexible hose between the engine, tender and cars to cylinders and pistons under the tender and each car, by which the pressure is transmitted to the brake levers, and thence to the brake shoes. This system is what is now termed the straight-air brake. This brake is now obsolete in steam road practice, having been replaced by the Automatic Air Brake.[3]
Air brake hose — Flexible tubes made of alternate layers of rubber and canvas by which the brake pipes under engines, tenders, and cars are connected together, and compressed air, which operates the brakes, conducted through the train. The hose is made with a coupling at each end of the engine and tender so that it can readily be connected or disconnected. Also called air hose and brake hose.[3]

Westinghouse Air Brake. — A system of continuous brakes invented and patented (the first patent in 1869) by Mr. George Westinghouse, which is operated by compressed air. The air is compressed, by a steam air pump on the locomotive or an electric motor compressor on the car. and is stored up in a tank called the main reservoir on the engine or tender. By the original form of brake the compressed air was conveyed from the tank by pipes connected together between the cars by flexible brake hose to brake cylinders under each car. by means of which the pressure of the air was communicated to the brake levers, and thence to the brake shoes. A later and improved form is the Westinghouse automatic air brake, commonly called simply Westinghouse brake, which is now in universal use. At the present time the Westinghouse brake, unless otherwise specified, is always understood to mean the automatic air brake. The change made from the original form of the Westinghouse air brake in order to make it automatic was to carry a full pressure of air at all times in the brake pipes and cause the brakes to be applied by a reduction of this pressure instead of by the admission of pressure, so that the breaking apart of the train or a reduction of pressure by escape of air at any point on the brake pipe would apply the brakes to the whole train at once. A further advantage was that the action of the brakes was made quicker by saving the appreciable interval of time required for the compressed air to flow from a single reservoir at one end of the train in sufficient quantities to fill all the brake cylinders. An auxiliary reservoir is placed under each car, containing air at the same pressure as in the brake pipes. An ingenious valve called the triple valve connects the brake pipe, auxiliary reservoir and brake cylinder together in such manner that any reduction of pressure in the brake pipe opens a passage for the air from the auxiliary reservoir to the brake cylinder, applying the brakes, and closes the connection between brake pipe and reservoir. To release the brakes, the pressure in the brake pipes is restored, when the triple valve closes the connection between the auxiliary reservoir and brake cylinder and opens one between the brake cylinder and the outer air and between the auxiliary reservoir and the brake pipe. In order that the train brakes may be applied from any car, each car is fitted with a valve called the conductor's valve, connected to the brake pipe so that the compressed air therein can be permitted to escape by opening the valve.
Westinghouse E-T locomotive brake equipment (air brake) — A new arrangement of air brake apparatus as applied to a locomotive. It differs from previous locomotive brake schedules principally in that the details are centralized and simplified so as to reduce the total number required, occupy less space, and give the engineman a mere certain and flexible control of the locomotive brakes. It has all the good features of any of the older equipment, besides a number of new ones, viz., uniform brake cylinder pressure on engine and tender, and a pressure-maintaining feature by which the brake-cylinder pressure is automatically held to that resulting from the brake application as long as such application lasts. See Distributing Valve.
Westinghouse friction draft gear — A form of draft gear in which the forces are absorbed and dissipated by friction. The friction device is encased in a malleable iron cylinder open at the front end. The front follower bears against a preliminary spring, the other end of which bears against the center wedge of the shape of the frustum of an octagonal pyramid. Surrounding the wedge are four pairs of segmental carriers having one rib each which lies in a groove in the cylinder. The other grooves in the cylinder are filled by friction strips resting on the carriers. These strips are of wrought iron and have lugs formed on them which engage in corresponding cavities in the carriers so that the friction strips must move with the carriers. The function of the preliminary spring is to absorb the light shocks without bringing into action the friction parts. The main release spring, placed back of the carriers, forces the carriers to their normal position when the pressure is removed and also adds to the capacity of the device. When the follower plates are moved toward each other, the preliminary spring is compressed until its capacity of 20,000 pounds is exceeded, when the follower bears against the release pin and forces it forward, relieving the wedge from the pressure of the auxiliary release spring, thereby allowing the compression of the preliminary and auxiliary preliminary springs to force the wedge forward and press the segmental carriers and friction strips firmly into the cylinder grooves. The follower then strikes and forces the segmental carriers in, producing friction between the friction strips and the grooves. The complete movement gives a resistance of 100,000 pounds. In releasing, the preliminary spring is gradually restored, and the auxiliary release spring then forces the wedge out, while the release spring returns the friction strips and carriers, giving a complete release. Owing to the varying width of the slots and lugs on the friction strips and carriers the strips are released four at a time through successive small distances. The operations of buffing and pulling are exactly the same, except that the load comes on the front or rear follower first, as the case may be. See Draft Gear.
Westinghouse SWA-SWB locomotive brake equipment — See Combined automatic and Straight-air locomotive brake.
Westinghouse traction brake — The adaptation of the Westinghouse air brake equipments to electrically propelled cars or trains. The changed conditions of motive power and method of operating such cars or trains have necessitated various changes in the details of the equipments, while the general principles of the Westinghouse straight-air and automatic brakes, which are the foundation of all known air brake equipments, remains the same. A motor-driven air compressor furnishes the compressed air; an electric pump governor controls the operation of the same; the brake and triple valves are of different design to accord with the conditions for which they are required. Otherwise the description of the Westinghouse Air Brake, which see, covers the traction brake also.

A reverse switch and auxiliary resistance are essential parts of the apparatus'under each car. The apparatus is applicable for cither direct current or alternating current motors. Also called Westinghouse electro-pneumatic system of control.
Wheel — The rolling component typically pressed onto an axle and mounted on a rail car or locomotive truck or bogie. Wheels are cast or forged (wrought) and are heat treated to have a specific hardness. New wheels are trued to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles must be periodically monitored to insure proper wheel to rail interface. Improperly trued wheels increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire around the outside. A railway tire is itself steel, and is typically heated and pressed onto the wheel, where it remains firmly as it shrinks and cools.
Wheel — 1.  A circular frame or solid piece of wood or metal which revolves on an axis.A circular frame or disk, revolving on an axle, serving to support a moving vehicle. Engine truck wheels are sometimes made of chilled cast iron, but more commonly have a cast iron or cast steel center with a steel tire fastened on, as are also tender truck wheels. See Wheel Center.' Driving wheels and trailing wheels are always made with a spoke center of cast iron or cast steel with a steel tire shrunk on. In addition to shrinkage, driving wheel tires are held on by bolts through the rim and by retaining rings also held by bolts..  {{{content}}}

Whyte notation — A system of describing steam locomotive wheel arrangements (e.g. 4-6-4, 2-10-2). The first number indicates the number of "pilot" wheels that help lead the engine into turns. The second is the number of coupled wheels ("drivers"). Third are the trailing idler wheels, usually to provide support to larger fireboxes. Articulated locomotives are similarly described. For example, a Union Pacific "Big Boy" would be described as a 4-8-8-4, wherein the pilot has four wheels, followed by two sets of drivers, eight wheels per set, and a four-wheel trailing bogie under the firebox. The numbers include the wheels on both sides of the engine, so a 2-8-2 engine would have one idler, four drivers, and a final idler on each side of the engine.
